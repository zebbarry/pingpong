START:
Board is ready to start a game when the words 'PONG' are scrolling
across the screen. When with another board that also has "PONG" displaying,
press down the joystick button to start the game. You will start with the ball.

CONTROL:
Your paddle can be moved from left to right by moving the joystick left or right.
The ball will bounce off your paddle at different angles based on which part
of the paddle it hits.
If it connects with the left side of the paddle, it will bounce off to the left.
If it connects with the centre of the paddle, it will bounce off straight.
if it connects with the right side of the paddle, it will bounce off the the right.

RULES:
The ball is allowed to bounce off the walls but if you miss it with your paddle
then it will reach the end and you will lose a point!

Once the ball bounces back to the far side of the display it will move onto the
other players display.

If either player scores a point, the score will be displayed on both screens,
with your score first and their score second. e.g. if the score was 3-nil to you,
the display would read "30".

The ball will start out slow but as you pass the ball back and forth it will start
to speed up until either player scores a point, then it will restart again at the
slower speed.

HOW TO WIN:
The winner of the game is the first person to score three points! To do this you
will need to be cunning and bounce the ball off at different angles and try to
sneak the ball past the other players paddle.

Once the game is over, press the joystick button down again to restart again with
the ball.
